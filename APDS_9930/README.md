APDS-9930 is a digital I2C compatible interface ambient light sensor (ALS) and proximity sensor with IR LED in a single 8-pin package.  The ambient light sensor utilizes dual photodiodes to approximate the human eye response with a low lux performance at 0.01 lux.  This high sensitivity allows for the device to operate behind a darkened glass. The proximity sensor is fully calibrated to detection of objects  to 100 mm thus eliminating the need for factory calibration of the end equipment or sub-assembly. The proximity detection feature operates well from bright sunlight to dark rooms. The addition of the micro-optics lenses within the module, provide highly efficient transmission and reception of infrared energy which lowers overall power dissipation.  In addition, an internal state machine provides the ability to put the device into a low power mode in between ALS and proximity measurements providing very low average power consumption.
