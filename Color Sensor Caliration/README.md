The TCS239 operates on a wide voltage rate and outputs square wave whose frequency reflects the color intensity
 Signal output
The signal output by the TCS230 is obtained by a current to frequency converter that takes as its input the average current from the selected set of photodiodes. 
The idea is that you switch one set on, take a reading and then switch to the next set until all four measurements are done. 
The output signal is a square wave with even mark to space ratio: 50% high, 50% low.
