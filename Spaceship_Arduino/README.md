This is a program that shows how a breadboard-button works and how we can affect the LEDs by either pressing the button down (2 of the leds will turn on) or by not pressing the button (keeping the led up)


The output can be found here:

Made a few changes to the code now we have a constant On state and when we press the breadboard-button the LEDs blink (when the mid led is on the left and the right led are on and vice versa)
