# Arduino_UNO_R3_ATmega328P - Sequential_blinking.ino
--------

First we will need to connect the Red, Yellow and Green led on the arduino pin_13,pin_12,pin_11 that are located exactly down the Ground. Next, we use Resistors of 220 ohm and then we connect them as the picture suggests 9we can find all the pictures on the "Sequential_blinking.rar". Then we upload the sketch from the arduino ide and the code should work like the video suggests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Wh-FmlTCo
