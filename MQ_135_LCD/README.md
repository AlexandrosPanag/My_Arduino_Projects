Main chip: LM393,MQ-135 gas sensor
Operating voltage: DC 5V
With signal output indicator instructions.
Dual signal output (analog output, and TTL level output).
TTL output valid signal is low level, (output low signal light, which can be accessed microcontroller IO port).
Analog output with increasing concentration, the higher the concentration, the higher the voltage.
with high sensitivity and good selectivity for Sulfide, benzene Department of steam, smoke and other harmful gases.
Has a long service life and reliable stability.
Rapid response and recovery characteristics.
Size:36mm X24mm X25mm(L * W * H)
Some Application: A hazardous gas detection apparatus for the family, the environment. Suitable for ammonia, aromatic compounds, sulfur, benzene vapor, smoke and other gases harmful gas detection. Gas-sensitive element test concentration range: 10 to 1000ppm
