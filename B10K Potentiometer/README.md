What is a Potentiometer?

A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper moves, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.

There are various types of potentiometers:

digital potentiometer
rotary potentiometer
logarithmic potentiometer
manually adjustable potentiometer
linear potentiometer
The measuring instrument called a potentiometer. This is essentially an output voltage divider used for measuring the potential energy (voltage); the component measures the resistance of the potentiometer, hence its name.

Potentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment. Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position transducers, for example, in a game joystick. Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power (more than a single watt), since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load.
