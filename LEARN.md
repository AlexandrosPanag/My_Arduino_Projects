Most of my programs were compiled on my Arduino Uno Rev 3 microcontroller, including, the Arduino Nano 33 IoT and Arduino Nano BLE microcontrollers which were provided to me by the Autonomous Systems Laboratory of the University of Ioannina, Department of Informatics & Telecommunications.

_Some of the programs may or may not be compatible with every arduino board or require an alternative pin connection depending on your board module, make sure you check your board's diagram and identify the appropriate pin connection._


__Special thanks__ to the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at the Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, for providing me with the necessary equipment including a variety of different sensors and different Arduino-boards in order to make this repository possible :)

Arduino
--------------------


Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.

Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.
