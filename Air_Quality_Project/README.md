This project is using an LCD I2C Screen display, DH11  and the MQ_135 Sensor in order to work. 

This project can measure the humidity level, and the air quality (PPM) and lastly print them on the lcd screen. This project is used in order to evaluate our air quality and give us valuable health results.

OPTIONAL : We can also evolve the project in order to give us the current temperature as the DHT11 examples that i made, suggest.
