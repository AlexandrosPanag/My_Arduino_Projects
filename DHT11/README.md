A few of the key elements that DHT11 has:
-Ultra low cost


-3 to 5V power and I/O


-2.5mA max current use during conversion (while requesting data)


-Good for 20-80% humidity readings with 5% accuracy


-Good for 0-50°C temperature readings ±2°C accuracy


-No more than 1 Hz sampling rate (once every second)


-Body size 15.5mm x 12mm x 5.5mm


-4 pins with 0.1" spacing




DHT11
--------------


A program that uses the DHT11 semspr om prder tp identify & print into the Serial Monitor the current humidity and temperature.
If the temperature is above 25 celcius the program will blink.
