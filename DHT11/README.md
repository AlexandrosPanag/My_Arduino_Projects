ATTENTION: PLEASE CHECK YOUR DHT11 SENSOR MODULE! IF IT DOESN'T RESEMBLE THE PICTURE OR HAS MORE THAN 1 PIN YOU NEED TO CHECK THE PIN CONNECTION (some DHT11 sensors have the VCC & GND backwards!!! )!

The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed).

A program that uses the DHT11 sensor in order to identify & print into the Serial Monitor the current humidity and temperature.
If the temperature is above 25 celcius the program will blink.
