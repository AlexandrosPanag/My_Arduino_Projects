Library Archive for My Arduino & ESP32 Projects

Legacy version 2022:
This repository serves as a backup archive for all the libraries used in my projects. It ensures that any library—whether deprecated, removed, or improperly installed from Arduino sources—remains accessible for future use.

Note:
For the most recent updates or changes to these libraries, please check this link.
