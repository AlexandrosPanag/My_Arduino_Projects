SparkFun HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is an economic sensor that is designed to evaluate HC-SR04. This sensor comes with additional control circuitry that prevents inconsistent bouncy data according to application. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor offers 2cm to 400cm of non-contact functionality with a ranging accuracy that reaches up to 3mm. This HC-SR04 sensor consists of 4-pins, ultrasonic transmitter, a receiver, and a control circuit.
